# JavaScript, Bootstrap and UFOs!

## Overview of Project

## Background
In this module, you will create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

JavaScript is a well-established coding language that was designed to enhance HTML. It's the backbone of many popular visualization libraries, such as Plotly, and is often used to create custom dashboards. JavaScript also provides a high level of customization: the dashboards built to deliver visual data, such as maps or graphs, can be as simple or complex as needed.

Dana is data journalist who is at a point in her career where she has the freedom to choose the topic she wants to write about. When she is given the opportunity to write about her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon, she jumps on it for a couple of reasons. First, it is an opportunity to revist the memories and people back home. Second, and the really fun part is the topic - UFOs!. McMinnville, is famouse for its sitings and even has an annual gathering of UFO enthusiats. It is a topic that Dana has been interested in since she was a child when she first heard abot farmer trent's siting back in 1950. 

For the this assignment the only thing she has to go on so far is a JavaScript file filled to the brim with siting information: countries, cities, states, types of sitings, etc. There is a lot in the file. Thankfully, Dana is aware of JavaScript's visual functionality. 

Her plan is to first use JavaScript to display the data as a table. However, because there is so much data. Sifting through it without any adjustments would be a challenege. JavaScript provides a way to manipulate the data without adding filters. It is a little tricky to add more than one filter, but Dana is up for the challenege. Additionally, since she will be posting her artcile online, Dana wants to put everything together in that tidy HTML page, her article, the table of data to support her findings and easy to use filters to fine tune the results. Dana is looking forward to seeing her idea come to life. 

## Purpose
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation. Include images.

**The overall results/output looks as follows...

**Dana, you can use "FILTER SEARCH" area on the webpage to search by data, city, state, country, or shape. 

- For example, if we wanted to see sitings for the following criteria...

- It will results in the following results...

- You can also use the clear button to clear your filter search crtieria, and the webpage will resort back to its original state, with all siting information listed...

## Summary
1. Address one drawback of this webpage
2. Address two additional recommendations for further development
